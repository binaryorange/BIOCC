# Welcome to ECCS -- Enhanced ClippedCamera Setup
 Attempting to improve the default behavior of Godot's ClippedCamera node by using a mult-target and multi-camera setup.

# Project Goals
-- Reusable scene consisting of a typical gimbal setup
-- Controllable with mouse/keyboard or gamepad
-- Take the chore of creating a polished third-person camera system away so that the end-user can spend more time developing their game!

# To stay updated and gleen details...
...visit my blog where progress reports will be made in such a schedule as I see fit! https://binaryorangestudios.wordpress.com/

# TODO, and coming up - instructions on how to use this node when it is officially released! Stay tuned!
